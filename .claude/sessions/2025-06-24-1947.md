## Progress

### 19:47 - Session Started
- Created session file
- Ready to begin development

### 19:48 - Issue #104 Review Complete
- Reviewed issue #104: "Consolidate session key validation systems"
- Found that ALL implementation tasks have been completed:

  - ✅ SessionKeyState enum standardized (single enum in `types/domain/session.ts`)
  - ✅ `useSessionKey` hook updated to use unified system
  - ✅ `BattleNadsClient` updated to use unified system
  - ✅ No duplicate validation logic remains
- The consolidation work described in issue #104 is complete!

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Issue Review:** Thoroughly reviewed GitHub issue #104 regarding session key validation consolidation
2. **Verification:** Confirmed that all implementation tasks were already completed:
   - State machine approach removed (`sessionKeyMachine.ts` deleted)
   - Unified validation utility exists (`sessionKeyValidation.ts`)
   - SessionKeyState enum standardized
   - All components using unified system
3. **Issue Closure:** Successfully closed issue #104 on GitHub with appropriate completion comment

### Features Implemented
- No new features (verification session only)

### Problems Encountered
- None - the expected work was already complete

### Important Findings
1. **Session Key Consolidation Complete:** The session key validation systems have already been successfully consolidated into a single unified system
2. **Clean Architecture:** The consolidated system lives in `src/utils/sessionKeyValidation.ts` with:
   - Two validation functions: `validateSessionKey` (full validation) and `validateSessionKeyData` (simplified)
   - Standardized `SessionKeyState` enum in `types/domain/session.ts`
   - All components properly migrated to use the unified system

### Breaking Changes
- None

### Dependencies
- No changes

### Configuration Changes
- None

### Deployment Steps
- None required

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify current implementation status before starting work on an issue
2. Code comments in the consolidated utility clearly indicate the merge of both systems
3. The codebase is well-maintained with completed work properly integrated

### What Wasn't Completed
- N/A - This was a verification and closure session only

### Tips for Future Developers
1. When working on consolidation issues, check if the work might already be done
2. The session key validation utility (`src/utils/sessionKeyValidation.ts`) is the single source of truth
3. Use `validateSessionKey` for full validation with embedded wallet checks
4. Use `validateSessionKeyData` for simplified validation without embedded wallet checks

### Session Type
This was a **verification and issue closure session** - no code changes were required as the implementation was already complete.
