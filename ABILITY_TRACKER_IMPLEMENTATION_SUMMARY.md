# AbilityTracker Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the AbilityTracker data from the smart contract into the Battle-Nads frontend. The ability data is now properly flowing from the contract through the data transformation layers to the UI hooks.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. **Contract Structure Alignment**
- Updated type definitions to match the exact `BattleNad` struct from the smart contract
- Fixed field ordering in array-to-object conversion:
  ```typescript
  0: id, 1: stats, 2: maxHealth, 3: weapon, 4: armor, 
  5: inventory, 6: tracker, 7: activeTask, 8: activeAbility, 
  9: owner, 10: name
  ```

### 2. **Data Flow Architecture**
- AbilityTracker remains part of the Character model (`character.activeAbility`)
- Data flows: Contract → Adapter → Mapper → Domain Model → UI Hooks
- No changes needed to the overall architecture

### 3. **Enhanced Hooks**

#### `useAbilityCooldowns` (Updated)
- Now correctly reads from `character.ability`
- Provides ability status and action functions
- Handles optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback

#### `useAbilityTracker` (New)
- Dedicated hook for detailed ability state tracking
- Provides:
  - Current stage (READY, CHARGING, ACTION, COOLDOWN)
  - Stage progress percentage (0-100%)
  - Time remaining in seconds
  - Stage durations for each ability
- Ready for client-side stage progression

### 4. **Stage Durations Defined**

Example durations (in blocks):
```typescript
Fireball: { charging: 8, action: 4, cooldown: 56 }
ShieldBash: { charging: 4, action: 2, cooldown: 24 }
SingSong: { charging: 2, action: 2, cooldown: 0 } // Bard no cooldown
```

## Current State

- ✅ Contract types updated and aligned
- ✅ Data mapping fixed and tested
- ✅ All tests passing with updated mock data
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Debug logging removed
- ✅ Documentation updated

## Next Steps for Visual Indicators

### 1. **Update AbilityButton Component**
```typescript
// Use both hooks for complete ability state
const { abilities, useAbility } = useAbilityCooldowns(characterId);
const { abilityTracker } = useAbilityTracker();

// Show different visuals based on stage
if (abilityTracker?.currentStage === AbilityStage.CHARGING) {
  // Show charging animation
} else if (abilityTracker?.currentStage === AbilityStage.ACTION) {
  // Show action animation
}
```

### 2. **Implement Stage-Specific Animations**
- **CHARGING**: Pulsing or filling progress bar
- **ACTION**: Active glow or particle effects
- **COOLDOWN**: Grayed out with countdown timer
- **READY**: Normal state with hover effects

### 3. **Add Progress Indicators**
```typescript
<CircularProgress 
  value={abilityTracker.stageProgress} 
  size="40px"
/>
<Text>{abilityTracker.timeRemaining.toFixed(1)}s</Text>
```

### 4. **Implement Optimistic Updates**
- When ability is used, immediately show CHARGING stage
- Progress through stages based on calculated durations
- Reconcile with contract data when available

## Testing Considerations

1. **Test Different Abilities**: Each class has unique timings
2. **Test Stage Transitions**: Ensure smooth visual transitions
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Rapid ability use, network delays
4. **Test Optimistic Updates**: Ensure they match actual contract state

## Performance Considerations

- Use `React.memo` for AbilityButton to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consider throttling progress updates to reduce render frequency
- Cache ability icons and animations

## Conclusion

The AbilityTracker integration is complete and ready for visual indicator implementation. The data is properly flowing from the contract to the UI layer, and the new hooks provide all necessary information for creating rich, stage-based ability animations.
