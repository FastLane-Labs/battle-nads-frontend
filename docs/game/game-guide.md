## Exploring the Dungeon

### The Three-Dimensional World

Battle Nads' dungeon exists in three dimensions:
- **X-axis**: East ‚Üê ‚Üí West
- **Y-axis**: North ‚Üê ‚Üí South  
- **Z-axis**: Up ‚Üê ‚Üí Down (depth levels)

Each location can hold up to 64 heroes. When you move, you're exploring an infinite procedurally generated world.

### Movement & Monster Encounters

**How Movement Works:**
1. Click any directional arrow to move
2. Your hero walks to the new location
3. If monsters lurk there, combat begins automatically
4. Win the battle to claim that spot

**Monster Spawning:**
- Moving to a new location may spawn monsters
- Deeper levels (lower Z) have tougher enemies
- Monster strength scales with dungeon depth
- Each area generates monsters based on its coordinates

**Finding Staircases:**
- Special locations contain staircases
- Use them to move between depth levels
- Deeper levels = better rewards but harder monsters
- Surface level (Z: 0) is safest for new heroes

### Navigation Tips

- Start by exploring horizontally (X/Y axes) at depth 0
- Build strength before venturing deeper
- Remember your path - respawning puts you back at origin
- Watch for other heroes' movements in the activity feed
