- Start playing with gasless transactions

## Exploring the Dungeon

### The Three-Dimensional World

Battle Nads' dungeon exists in three dimensions:
- **X-axis**: East ‚Üê ‚Üí West
- **Y-axis**: North ‚Üê ‚Üí South  
- **Z-axis**: Up ‚Üê ‚Üí Down (depth levels)

Each location can hold up to 64 heroes. The dungeon spans 50 floors from depth 1 to the deepest level at depth 50.

### Movement & Monster Encounters

**How Movement Works:**
1. Click any directional arrow to move
2. Your hero enters the new location (64 slots available)
3. If monsters spawn in your slot, combat begins automatically
4. Combat proceeds automatically once initiated
5. Movement is always possible (for state cleanup/recovery, but only allowed when not in combat)

**Monster Spawning:**
- Moving to a new location may spawn monsters
- Deeper levels (lower Z) have tougher enemies
- Monster strength scales with dungeon depth
- Each area generates monsters based on its coordinates

**Finding Staircases:**
- Special locations contain staircases
- Use them to move between depth levels
- Deeper levels = better rewards but harder monsters
- Boss monsters guard each staircase

**First 4 Staircase Locations:**
- Depth 1‚Üí2: **(25, 25)** - Center of the map
- Depth 2‚Üí3: **(35, 15)** - Southeast quadrant
- Depth 3‚Üí4: **(15, 35)** - Northwest quadrant
- Depth 4‚Üí5: **(14, 14)** - Southwest quadrant

### Player Interactions

**When Multiple Players Share a Location:**
- Attack other players for 3x experience rewards (PvP)
- Monks can heal allies in the same area
- Up to 64 entities can occupy one location
- Combat happens when entities share the same slot position within a location

### Navigation Tips

- Start by exploring horizontally (X/Y axes) at depth 1
- Build strength before venturing deeper
- Remember your path - respawning puts you back at origin
- Watch for other heroes' movements in the activity feed

## Combat & Abilities

### Strategic Combat System

When you encounter monsters:
1. You choose whether to attack (no retreat for spawned monsters)
2. Once you initiate combat, defense is automatic

### Combat Flow

4. **Victory**: Defeat all monsters to claim the location

## Death & Rebirth

### The Cycle of Heroes

Death isn't the end in Battle Nads:

**When You Fall:**
- Your hero respawns at origin (25, 25, 1)
- You lose your entire character balance (shMON earned in-game)
- Your bonded balance remains safe
- A monument marks where you died

**Death Monuments:**
- Show where heroes have fallen
- Display the hero's name and class
- Serve as warnings for dangerous areas
- Create a living history of the dungeon

### Strategic Deaths

Sometimes death can be tactical:
- Return to origin quickly
- Redistribute wealth (10% goes to survivors)
- Escape from deep, dangerous areas
- Reset your position for new exploration

---

## Treasures & Equipment

### Finding Gear

Equipment drops from defeated monsters:
- **Weapons**: 64 different types with varying damage
- **Armor**: 64 different types with varying defense
- Each equipment type has level requirements

### Equipment System

- Different equipment types offer different stat bonuses
- Higher-level equipment requires character progression
- Equipment persists through death
- Stats vary by equipment type, not rarity tiers

### Managing Your Equipment

- Equip items through your character screen
- Compare stats before swapping gear
- Check level requirements before equipping
- Your equipment determines your combat effectiveness

## The shMON Economy

### Understanding shMON

shMON is a [liquid staking token](https://shmonad.xyz) that powers Battle Nads:
- **Character Balance**: Earned by defeating monsters (lost on death)
- **Bonded Balance**: Protected funds for auto-defense (survives death)
- **Staking Rewards**: Stake at [shmonad.xyz](https://shmonad.xyz) for RPC benefits
- **Dual Purpose**: In-game currency and infrastructure token

### Token Distribution

When a hero dies:
- Their entire character balance is lost
- A portion may be dropped for other players (varies by game mode)
- Bonded balance remains with the account
- Creates risk/reward dynamics

### Spending shMON

Use your tokens for:
- Creating additional heroes
- Future marketplace transactions
- Special dungeon features
- Trading with other players (coming soon)
