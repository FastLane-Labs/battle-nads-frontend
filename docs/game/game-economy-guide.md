# Battle Nads Economy Guide

## üí∞ Understanding the shMON Economy

Battle Nads operates on a sophisticated token economy using **shMON** (staked MON) tokens that drive all game mechanics, rewards, and player progression.

### Core Economic Concepts

#### shMON Token System

- **shMON** = Staked MON tokens locked in the game contract
- **1 shMON = 1 MON** when you stake into the game
- **Yield generation** - shMON holders earn yield from game activity
- **Deflationary mechanics** - Tokens are permanently redistributed through gameplay

#### Three Types of Balances

**1. Wallet Balance (MON)**

- Regular MON tokens in your wallet
- Used for: Character creation, session key funding, staking into game
- **Management**: Keep some MON for gas fees and emergency funding

**2. Character Balance (shMON)**

- Your in-game earned balance from defeating enemies
- **Earned by**: Killing players and monsters
- **Lost by**: Death (redistributed to victor)
- **Strategy**: This is your "score" and primary risk/reward mechanism

**3. Bonded Balance (shMON)**

- Minimum locked balance required for character operations
- **Minimum**: 0.05 shMON to prevent character deletion
- **Used for**: Task execution gas costs (~0.003-0.005 MON per action)
- **Critical**: Character deleted if this drops below minimum

## üìä Economic Mechanics

### Character Creation Economics

```txt
Total Cost: ~0.15 MON
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Buy-in: 0.1 shMON (locked in game)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bonded Balance: 0.05 shMON (minimum for operations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gas Buffer: Variable (for transactions)
```

### Yield Distribution System

When a player is defeated, their balance is distributed:

- **75%** ‚Üí Victor (player or monster that killed them)
- **25%** ‚Üí **Yield Boost Pool** (distributed to ALL shMON holders)

**Example**: Player with 1.0 shMON dies

- Victor gets: 0.75 shMON
- All shMON holders share: 0.25 shMON proportionally

### Task Economy

Every automated action costs MON from your bonded balance:

- **Combat turn**: ~0.003 MON
- **Movement**: ~0.004 MON  
- **Ability usage**: ~0.003-0.005 MON
- **Character spawning**: ~0.005 MON

**Daily costs for active play**: ~0.1-0.3 MON depending on activity

## üí° Economic Strategies

### Conservative Strategy (Low Risk)

**Goal**: Steady yield from gameplay with minimal death risk

- **Target**: Same-level or weaker enemies
- **Balance Management**: Keep modest character balance (0.1-0.5 shMON)
- **Playstyle**: Safe exploration, avoid dangerous areas
- **Return**: 3-8% weekly yield from yield boost pool + small victories

### Aggressive Strategy (High Risk/Reward)

**Goal**: Maximum character balance growth through PvP

- **Target**: Higher-level players and valuable monsters
- **Balance Management**: Accumulate large character balance (1.0+ shMON)
- **Playstyle**: Deep dungeon exploration, active PvP hunting
- **Return**: 50-200%+ potential gains but high death risk

### Yield Farming Strategy (Passive Income)

**Goal**: Maximize yield boost returns with minimal active play

- **Method**: Create multiple low-level characters
- **Focus**: Keep characters alive to maintain shMON stake
- **Activity**: Minimal combat, focus on survival
- **Return**: Steady yield from other players' deaths

### Hybrid Strategy (Recommended)

**Goal**: Balance risk and reward for sustainable growth

- **Character Management**: One main character + backup characters
- **Balance Cycling**: Cash out (ascend) when character balance gets large
- **Risk Management**: Know when to retreat and preserve gains
- **Return**: Moderate but consistent growth with controlled risk

## üìà Economic Optimization

### Balance Management Tactics

#### The "Ascend" Strategy

- **When**: Character balance reaches 2-3x your initial investment
- **How**: Use ascend function to cash out before risking death
- **Why**: Preserves gains and allows fresh start with improved equipment

#### The "Death Insurance" Approach

- **Method**: Maintain multiple characters as economic backup
- **Benefit**: If main character dies, you still have staked shMON earning yield
- **Cost**: Higher initial investment but lower total risk

#### Dynamic Risk Assessment

**Safe Zones** (Low death risk):

- Depth 1-2 with appropriate level enemies
- Areas with few other players
- Fighting monsters 2+ levels below you

**Danger Zones** (High death risk):

- Deep dungeons (Depth 10+)
- Boss fight areas
- High-traffic PvP zones
- Fighting players higher level than you

### Market Timing Strategies

#### Economic Cycles

Battle Nads economy has observable patterns:

- **Growth periods**: New players entering, rising activity
- **Correction periods**: High-level player deaths redistributing wealth
- **Consolidation**: Wealth accumulates in fewer hands

#### Optimal Entry/Exit Points

**Enter game when**:

- Major player deaths create yield boost opportunities
- New game features drive player adoption
- Market sentiment is optimistic

**Cash out when**:

- Your character balance represents significant real-world value
- You've achieved your profit targets
- Market feels saturated or risky

## ‚öñÔ∏è Risk Management

### Economic Risks

#### Character Death (Highest Risk)

- **Impact**: Loss of 100% character balance
- **Mitigation**: Regular ascension, conservative play, escape planning
- **Acceptance**: Budget only what you can afford to lose

#### Task Balance Depletion

- **Impact**: Character deletion, loss of all staked shMON
- **Mitigation**: Monitor bonded balance, maintain buffer above 0.05
- **Prevention**: Regular balance top-ups, efficient gameplay

#### Market Risks

- **MON token price volatility**: Affects real-world value of gains
- **Game economy changes**: Updates may alter economic mechanics
- **Player exodus**: Reduced activity decreases yield opportunities

### Risk Tolerance Guidelines

**Conservative Players** (Risk-averse):

- Never risk more than 10% of total crypto holdings
- Focus on yield farming with minimal combat
- Multiple small characters rather than one large investment

**Moderate Players** (Balanced approach):

- Risk 25-50% of dedicated gaming budget
- Mix of safe farming and calculated PvP
- Active balance management with regular cash-outs

**Aggressive Players** (High risk tolerance):

- Willing to risk significant amounts for large gains
- Focus on high-level PvP and dangerous areas
- Accept potential total loss for maximum upside

## üìã Economic Best Practices

### Daily Economic Management

1. **Check bonded balance** - Ensure sufficient for planned activity
2. **Assess character balance** - Consider cash-out if significantly profitable
3. **Monitor yield earnings** - Track passive income from yield boost
4. **Evaluate risk/reward** - Adjust strategy based on current character value

### Weekly Economic Review

1. **Calculate total return** - Character balance + yield - costs
2. **Assess strategy effectiveness** - Are you meeting profit goals?
3. **Market analysis** - How is the broader game economy performing?
4. **Risk adjustment** - Increase or decrease risk based on results

### Emergency Procedures

**If character balance becomes very large**:
1. Consider immediate ascension to preserve gains
2. Increase caution - avoid unnecessary risks
3. Plan exit strategy if balance approaches significant real-world value

**If bonded balance runs low**:

1. Immediately add MON to prevent character deletion
2. Reduce activity to conserve balance
3. Focus on safe, profitable activities only

Remember: Battle Nads economy is **zero-sum with deflationary elements**. Your gains come from other players' losses, and some tokens are permanently removed from circulation. This creates both opportunity and risk - play responsibly and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
