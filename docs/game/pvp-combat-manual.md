# PvP Combat Guide

## Player vs Player Basics

PvP combat in Battle Nads demonstrates the blockchain's ability to handle complex player interactions in real-time.

### Key Differences from PvE

- **Higher Rewards**: 3x experience for defeating players
- **Economic Stakes**: Winner takes 75% of loser's shMON balance
- **Unpredictable**: Human opponents use varied strategies

### Basic PvP Strategy

#### Before Combat
- Check opponent's level and visible health
- Ensure your abilities are off cooldown
- Consider the economic risk vs reward

#### During Combat
- Combat is automated once initiated
- Use abilities strategically based on cooldowns
- Monitor health for defensive ability timing

### Class-Specific Tips

**Warriors**: Use ShieldBash early for stun advantage, ShieldWall when health drops below 50%

**Rogues**: Apply poison early for maximum damage, use EvasiveManeuvers defensively

**Monks**: Time healing abilities carefully due to long cooldowns, use Smite to prevent enemy healing

**Sorcerers**: Only use ChargeUp when safe from interruption, Fireball is most effective on high-health targets

### Risk Management

- Don't engage players significantly higher level
- Always consider your current balance at risk
- Remember: death means losing your entire balance to the opponent

### Simple Economics

The PvP system creates a dynamic economy where skilled players can accumulate wealth, but concentration of wealth makes them targets. This demonstrates:

- Economic game theory in action
- Risk/reward calculations
- Wealth redistribution mechanics

Remember: Battle Nads is a technology demonstration. The PvP system showcases how blockchain can handle complex, high-stakes player interactions without centralized servers.
