## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important First-Time Tips

### Combat Basics
- Combat is **turn-based** and **fully automated**
- **No transaction spam needed** - Task Manager handles all turns
- **Just click attack once** - combat continues automatically
- Higher **Quickness** = more frequent turns
- **Equipment matters** - upgrade when possible
- **Class abilities** have cooldowns - use strategically

### Economic Management
- **Death = loss of all balance** to the victor
- Keep minimum **0.05 MON bonded** to prevent character deletion
- Each action costs small amount of gas/MON
- **Balance vs Risk** - don't risk more than you can afford to lose

### Progression Strategy
- **Start conservative** - fight enemies at or below your level
- **Upgrade equipment** when you get better drops
- **Learn your class abilities** - they can turn the tide of battle
- **Explore gradually** - deeper levels have stronger enemies but better rewards
