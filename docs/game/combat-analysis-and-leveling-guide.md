## Combat System Overview

Battle Nads features a turn-based combat system where characters engage in tactical battles using six core attributes. Each character class has unique bonuses, penalties, and special abilities that define their optimal playstyle.

### Core Attributes

- **Strength**: Primary damage scaling
- **Vitality**: Health pool and regeneration
- **Dexterity**: Hit chance and minor damage bonus
- **Quickness**: Turn speed and hit/evasion
- **Sturdiness**: Defense and health pool
- **Luck**: Critical hits, turn speed, and damage/defense rolls

## Core Combat Mechanics

### Hit Calculation

```solidity
uint256 toHit = (
    ((HIT_MOD + attacker.dexterity) * (weapon.accuracy + BASE_ACCURACY))
        + attacker.luck + attacker.quickness
) / HIT_MOD;

uint256 toEvade = (
    ((EVADE_MOD + defender.dexterity + defender.luck) * (armor.flexibility + BASE_FLEXIBILITY))
    + defender.quickness
) / EVADE_MOD;
```

**Key Factors:**

- **Dexterity** is the primary hit stat (multiplied by weapon accuracy)
- **Luck** and **Quickness** provide additive bonuses
- **Armor flexibility** affects evasion capability

### Damage Calculation

```solidity
uint256 offense = (
    (BASE_OFFENSE + attacker.strength) * weapon.baseDamage
        + attacker.dexterity
) / BASE_OFFENSE;

uint256 defense = (
    (BASE_DEFENSE + defender.sturdiness) * armor.armorFactor
        + defender.dexterity
) / BASE_DEFENSE;
```

**Key Factors:**

- **Strength** is the primary damage stat (multiplied by weapon damage)
- **Sturdiness** is the primary defense stat (multiplied by armor factor)
- **Dexterity** provides minor bonuses to both offense and defense
- **Luck** affects bonus damage/defense rolls

### Turn Speed (Cooldown)

```solidity
function _cooldown(BattleNadStats memory stats) internal pure returns (uint256 cooldown) {
    uint256 quickness = uint256(stats.quickness) + 1;
    uint256 baseline = QUICKNESS_BASELINE; // 4
    cooldown = DEFAULT_TURN_TIME; // 8
    
    // Reduce cooldown based on quickness thresholds
    do {
        if (cooldown < 3) break;
        if (quickness < baseline) {
            if (quickness + uint256(stats.luck) > baseline) {
                --cooldown;
            }
            break;
        }
        --cooldown;
        baseline = baseline * 3 / 2 + 1;
    } while (cooldown > MIN_TURN_TIME); // 3
}
```

**Key Factors:**

- **Quickness** is the primary turn speed stat
- **Luck** can help reach quickness thresholds
- Faster turns = more actions = higher DPS and utility

### Health System

```solidity
maxHealth = baseHealth + (vitality * VITALITY_HEALTH_MODIFIER) // 100
    + (sturdiness * STURDINESS_HEALTH_MODIFIER); // 20

// In-combat regeneration
adjustedHealthRegeneration = (vitality * VITALITY_REGEN_MODIFIER) * cooldown / DEFAULT_TURN_TIME;
```

**Key Factors:**

- **Vitality** provides 5x more health than **Sturdiness**
- **Vitality** determines regeneration rate
- Regeneration is normalized by turn speed to prevent quickness abuse

**Class Modifiers:**

- `+strength` (level/3 + 2)
- `+vitality` (level/3 + 2)  
- `-quickness` (-1)
- `+max health` (level √ó 30 + 50)

**Abilities:**

- **ShieldBash**: Stuns target + high damage (scales with strength + dexterity + level)
- **ShieldWall**: Temporary defense buff, reduces incoming damage by 75%

**Optimal Build:**

| Priority | Attribute | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st | **Strength** | Primary damage + class bonus + ability scaling |
| 2nd | **Vitality** | Health pool + class bonus + sustain |

### üó°Ô∏è **ROGUE** - Critical Strike Assassin

**Class Modifiers:**

- `+dexterity` (level/3 + 2)
- `+quickness` (level/3 + 2)
- `+luck` (level/4)
- `-strength` (-1)
- `-max health` (level √ó 20 + 100)

**Abilities:**

- **EvasiveManeuvers**: Temporary evasion buff (3 turns active, 18 turn cooldown)
- **ApplyPoison**: DoT that deals percentage-based damage over 6 turns

**Optimal Build:**

| Priority | Attribute | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st | **Dexterity** | Hit chance + class bonus + damage |
| 2nd | **Luck** | Critical hits + class bonus + turn speed |
| 3rd | **Quickness** | Turn speed + class bonus + hit/evasion |
| 4th | **Sturdiness** | Defense (compensate for low health) |
| 5th | **Vitality** | Health regeneration + survivability |
| 6th | **Strength** | Least important (already penalized) |

**Strategy:**
Rogues are speed-based assassins that rely on landing critical hits and avoiding damage. The poison DoT is excellent against high-health targets, while EvasiveManeuvers provides escape options.

**Combat Tips:**

- Use EvasiveManeuvers before engaging tough enemies
- Apply poison to high-health targets early
- Focus on first-strike advantages with high quickness
- Critical hit scaling makes luck extremely valuable
- Avoid prolonged fights due to low health pool

### üôè **MONK** - Support/Survivalist

**Class Modifiers:**

- `+sturdiness` (level/3 + 2)
- `+luck` (level/3 + 2)
- `-dexterity` (-1)
- `+max health` (level √ó 20)
- **Enhanced health regeneration** (level √ó 2 + 10)

**Abilities:**

- **Pray**: Powerful self/ally heal (scales with luck + sturdiness, 18+72 turn cooldown)
- **Smite**: High damage + curse debuff (scales with luck + level)

**Optimal Build:**

| Priority | Attribute | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st | **Sturdiness** | Defense + class bonus + health + heal scaling |

| 6th | **Dexterity** | Least important (already penalized) |

**Strategy:**
Monks are the ultimate survivalists with unmatched healing capabilities. The combination of high defense, enhanced regeneration, and powerful healing makes them nearly unkillable in extended combat.

**Combat Tips:**

- Use Pray proactively, not reactively (long cooldown)
- Enhanced regeneration makes monks excellent for area grinding
- Smite's curse debuff prevents enemy healing
- High sturdiness + luck makes defensive builds extremely effective
- Can serve as group healer in team scenarios

### üî• **SORCERER** - Burst Damage Mage

**Class Modifiers:**

- `-strength` (-1)
- `-vitality` (-1)
- `-sturdiness` (-1)
- `-max health` (level √ó 30 + 50)

**Abilities:**

- **ChargeUp**: 3-stage damage buff (interrupted by stuns, 72 turn total duration)
- **Fireball**: Massive burst damage (scales with level + percentage of target's current health)

**Optimal Build:**

| Priority | Attribute | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st | **Luck** | Critical hits + turn speed + damage rolls |
| 2nd | **Dexterity** | Hit chance (compensate for penalties) |
| 3rd | **Quickness** | Turn speed + positioning |

| 5th | **Sturdiness** | Defense (compensate for penalty) |
| 6th | **Strength** | Least important (heavily penalized) |

**Strategy:**
Sorcerers are glass cannons that rely on positioning and timing. The ChargeUp + Fireball combo can eliminate most enemies in one hit, but leaves the sorcerer vulnerable during the charge phase.

**Combat Tips:**

- Use ChargeUp only when safe from interruption
- Fireball damage scales with enemy's current health - use early
- High luck maximizes critical hit potential
- Avoid prolonged combat due to stat penalties
- Positioning is crucial - stay out of enemy range while charging

### üéµ **BARD** - Challenge Mode

**Class Modifiers:**

- `-1` to **ALL** attributes
- `-max health` (level √ó 40 + 100)
- **Special mechanic**: Missed attacks against Bards become critical hits
- **Health regeneration**: Fixed at 1 per turn (worst in game)

**Abilities:**

- **SingSong**: Cosmetic/utility effect
- **DoDance**: Cosmetic/utility effect

**Optimal Build (Survival Focus):**

| Priority | Attribute | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st | **Vitality** | Health pool (desperately needed) |
| 2nd | **Sturdiness** | Defense (desperately needed) |
| 3rd | **Luck** | Only path to critical hits + turn speed |
| 4th | **Dexterity** | Hit chance |
| 5th | **Quickness** | Turn speed |
| 6th | **Strength** | Damage (already terrible) |

**Strategy:**
Bards are the ultimate challenge class. The unique mechanic where missed attacks become critical hits creates unpredictable combat scenarios. Focus entirely on survival stats.

**Combat Tips:**

- This is "hard mode" - expect frequent deaths
- The missed-attack-becomes-crit mechanic can occasionally save you
- Avoid combat when possible
- Consider bard as a roleplay/challenge class, not competitive
- Group play may be more viable than solo

## Universal Leveling Tips

### Early Game (Levels 1-15)

1. **Focus on your class's primary stat first**
2. **Get enough vitality to survive** (minimum 8-10 points)
3. **Don't neglect luck** - it affects multiple mechanics
4. **Prioritize equipment upgrades** over minor stat increases

### Mid Game (Levels 16-35)

1. **Balance survivability stats** (Vitality/Sturdiness)
2. **Optimize your class's secondary stats**
3. **Consider your combat style** (offensive vs defensive)
4. **Start specializing** based on preferred abilities

### Late Game (Levels 36-50)

1. **Fine-tune secondary stats** for your playstyle
2. **Maximize equipment synergy** with your build
3. **Consider PvP implications** of your build
4. **Experiment with hybrid builds** if comfortable

### Stat Priority Guidelines

**For All Classes:**

- **Luck is undervalued** - affects hit, crit, turn speed, and damage rolls
- **Don't dump vitality** - health regeneration keeps you fighting longer
- **Equipment multiplies stats** - weapon accuracy scales dexterity, armor scales sturdiness
- **Turn speed is exponential** - small quickness investments have big impacts

**Red Flags:**

- Completely ignoring any stat (even penalized ones)
- Forgetting that luck affects turn speed thresholds
- Underestimating the value of health regeneration
- Not considering ability scaling when allocating points

## Advanced Combat Considerations

### Status Effects & Interactions

- **Stunned**: Increases hit chance against you (+64 to enemy hit roll)
- **Blocking (ShieldWall)**: Reduces damage by 75%, prevents crits
- **Evasion**: Reduces enemy hit chance (-96 to their hit roll)
- **Praying**: Halves damage dealt, doubles health regen, prevents crits
- **Cursed**: Prevents health regeneration, reduces healing by 80%
- **Poisoned**: Reduces health regen by 75%, DoT damage
- **ChargedUp**: Doubles damage, prevents critical hits on your attacks
- **ChargingUp**: Vulnerable to critical hits

### Equipment Scaling

- **Weapon Accuracy** multiplies with dexterity for hit chance
- **Weapon Base/Bonus Damage** scales with strength
- **Armor Factor** multiplies with sturdiness for defense
- **Armor Flexibility** affects evasion capability
- Higher-tier equipment significantly outweighs minor stat differences

### Combat Optimization

1. **Understand breakpoints** - some stats have threshold effects
2. **Consider opponent types** - monsters vs players have different scaling
3. **Timing matters** - ability cooldowns and combat duration
4. **Positioning** - especially important for glass cannon classes
5. **Resource management** - health, abilities, and combat stamina
