## üìà Progression Mechanics

### Character Level Progression

#### Experience Gain
```
XP Sources:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Monster Kills: Base XP based on monster level
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player Kills: 3x XP bonus (major progression boost)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Boss Defeats: Significant XP rewards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Exploration: Minor XP for discovering new areas
```

#### Level Benefits
Each level provides:
- **+1 Stat Point** - Allocate to any attribute
- **+50 Base Health** - Increased survivability
- **Equipment Access** - Higher level gear becomes available
- **Class Bonuses** - Automatic stat increases based on class

#### Level Cap & Scaling
- **Maximum Level**: 50
- **Soft Caps**: Effectiveness gains diminish at higher levels
- **PvP Balance**: Level differences capped to prevent extreme imbalances
- **Progression Rate**: Slows significantly after level 30

### Equipment Progression Path

#### Early Game (Levels 1-15)
**Focus**: Basic equipment upgrades and stat foundations
- **Starting Gear**: Class-appropriate weapon and armor
- **Upgrade Strategy**: Any higher-level equipment is improvement
- **Priority**: Weapon damage > armor defense > specialized stats
- **Farming Spots**: Depth 1-3, same-level monsters

**Recommended Progression:**
1. **Level 3-5 Equipment** - First major upgrade from starting gear
2. **Balanced Stats** - Don't neglect any core attributes
3. **Equipment Basics** - Learn how accuracy and armor factor work
4. **Safe Farming** - Focus on consistent upgrades over risky ventures

#### Mid Game (Levels 16-30)
**Focus**: Specialized builds and strategic equipment choices
- **Build Definition**: Choose between damage, tank, or balanced builds
- **Equipment Synergy**: Combine equipment stats with character attributes
- **Risk Management**: Better equipment enables deeper exploration
- **PvP Consideration**: Equipment becomes crucial for player combat

**Strategic Considerations:**
1. **Primary Stat Scaling** - Equipment multiplies your character's stats
2. **Build Specialization** - Focus on equipment that supports your playstyle
3. **Risk/Reward Balance** - Better equipment allows fighting stronger enemies
4. **Market Awareness** - Understand equipment value for trading

#### Late Game (Levels 31-50)
**Focus**: Optimization and min-maxing for specific situations
- **Perfect Builds** - Every piece of equipment serves a purpose
- **Situational Gear** - Different loadouts for different challenges
- **Economic Efficiency** - Equipment choices impact economic viability
- **Meta Adaptation** - Adjust builds based on current player meta

## üéØ Equipment Optimization Strategies

### Stat Multiplication Effects

#### Weapon Damage Calculation
```solidity
Offense = (BASE_OFFENSE + Strength) * Weapon.BaseDamage + Dexterity
```
**Key Insights:**
- **Strength** is multiplied by weapon damage (massive scaling)
- Higher weapon damage = more value from Strength investment
- **Dexterity** provides flat bonus (good for any build)

#### Hit Chance Calculation
```solidity
ToHit = ((HIT_MOD + Dexterity) * Weapon.Accuracy + Luck + Quickness) / HIT_MOD
```
**Key Insights:**
- **Dexterity** is multiplied by weapon accuracy
- High accuracy weapons make Dexterity much more valuable
- **Luck** and **Quickness** provide flat bonuses

#### Defense Calculation  
```solidity
Defense = (BASE_DEFENSE + Sturdiness) * Armor.ArmorFactor + Dexterity
```
**Key Insights:**
- **Sturdiness** is multiplied by armor factor
- Heavy armor makes Sturdiness investment much more effective
- **Dexterity** provides flat defensive bonus

### Build-Specific Equipment Strategies

#### Glass Cannon Build (High Damage)
**Stat Priority**: Strength > Dexterity > Luck > Quickness
**Equipment Focus**:
- **Weapon**: Highest base damage available, accuracy secondary
- **Armor**: Light armor for flexibility, armor factor less important
- **Strategy**: Maximize damage output, rely on killing enemies quickly

**Recommended Equipment Progression**:
1. **Levels 1-15**: Any high-damage weapon, light armor for evasion
2. **Levels 16-30**: Specialized high-damage weapons, stat-boosting armor
3. **Levels 31-50**: Perfect damage scaling equipment, situational defensive gear

#### Tank Build (High Survivability)
**Stat Priority**: Vitality > Sturdiness > Strength > Dexterity
**Equipment Focus**:
- **Weapon**: Moderate damage with good accuracy for consistent hits
- **Armor**: Highest armor factor available, flexibility secondary
- **Strategy**: Outlast enemies, rely on health regeneration and defense

**Recommended Equipment Progression**:
1. **Levels 1-15**: Balanced weapon, heaviest armor available
2. **Levels 16-30**: Defense-optimized gear, health-boosting equipment
3. **Levels 31-50**: Maximum defense equipment, specialized survival gear

#### Balanced Build (Versatile)
**Stat Priority**: Balanced allocation based on equipment
**Equipment Focus**:
- **Weapon**: Good balance of damage and accuracy
- **Armor**: Medium armor with balanced stats
- **Strategy**: Adaptable to different situations, well-rounded performance

#### Speed/Evasion Build (Hit and Run)
**Stat Priority**: Quickness > Dexterity > Luck > Strength
**Equipment Focus**:
- **Weapon**: High accuracy, moderate damage
- **Armor**: Maximum flexibility, light armor
- **Strategy**: Avoid damage through evasion, frequent turns

## üèÜ Advanced Equipment Tactics

### Equipment Situational Swapping
**Concept**: Different situations require different optimal equipment
- **PvP Combat**: Maximum damage/defense gear
- **Monster Farming**: Efficient, sustainable equipment
- **Boss Fights**: Specialized gear for specific boss mechanics
- **Exploration**: Balanced gear for unknown encounters

### Equipment Value Assessment

#### Damage Per Second (DPS) Calculation
```
Weapon DPS = (Base Damage √ó Hit Chance √ó Critical Multiplier) / Turn Time
```
**Factors**:
- **Base Damage**: Weapon damage + character bonuses
- **Hit Chance**: Probability of successful attack
- **Critical Multiplier**: Based on Luck and weapon properties
- **Turn Time**: Based on Quickness and weapon speed

#### Effective Health Points (EHP)
```
EHP = Health / (1 - Damage Reduction)
```
**Factors**:
- **Health**: Total health from Vitality + Sturdiness + level
- **Damage Reduction**: Defense value converted to percentage
- **Evasion**: Additional effective health from avoiding attacks

### Equipment Economics

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Equipment Value Factors**:
- **Stat Improvement**: How much combat effectiveness increases
- **Acquisition Cost**: shMON or time investment required
- **Opportunity Cost**: Alternative uses of resources
- **Longevity**: How long equipment remains useful

#### Equipment Acquisition Strategies
**Farming Routes**:
- **Monster Grinding**: Reliable but slow equipment drops
- **Player Combat**: High-risk, high-reward equipment acquisition
- **Boss Hunting**: Rare but valuable equipment drops
- **Trading**: Exchange resources with other players (if available)

2. **Plan for next tier** - Work toward equipment 3-5 levels ahead
3. **Specialize gradually** - Don't abandon all secondary stats
4. **Test different builds** - Experiment with equipment combinations

### Late Game Mastery
1. **Perfect efficiency** - Every stat point and equipment choice optimized
2. **Situational adaptation** - Multiple equipment setups for different scenarios
