# F - Combat State Indicators

*(Implementation details below)*

**Design Ref Notes:**
*   **Goal:** Indicate when the player is in combat to prevent confusion when actions like movement are blocked.
*   **Logic:** State is active if the `combatants: CharacterLite[]` list from `useUiSnapshot` is not empty.
*   **Core Functionality:** While active, movement actions MUST be disabled.
*   **Related:** Part of core combat loop feedback; complements Area View (Feature H) which highlights specific combatants.

**UI & Implementation Details:**

1.  **"In Combat" Banner:**
    *   **Placement:** ~~Display prominently but unobtrusively (e.g., top center, near character status, or above action bar).~~ **REVISED:** Integrated directly into the `CharacterInfo` component below the character name/level.
    *   **Appearance:** Uses a red `Badge` component with the text `‚öîÔ∏è Fighting: [Opponent Name/Count] ‚öîÔ∏è`.
    *   **Transition:** Appears/disappears instantly with state change (no fade implemented).

2.  **Disabled Movement Buttons:**
    *   **Appearance:** Standard `isDisabled` state.
    *   **Tooltip (MVP Critical):** On hover, displays `‚öîÔ∏è Cannot move while in combat` when disabled due to combat.

3.  **Interaction:**
    *   `useGame` hook derives `isInCombat` boolean from `worldSnapshot.combatants.length > 0`.
    *   `isInCombat` prop is passed down to `MovementControls` (disabling logic & tooltip) and `CharacterInfo` (indicator display).

---

**Implementation Summary:**

*   Added `isInCombat` state derivation to `useGame` hook.
*   Removed the standalone `InCombatBanner` component.
*   Modified `CharacterInfo` to accept `combatants` prop and display a conditional `Badge` indicating combat status and opponent(s).
*   Updated `MovementControls` to accept `isInCombat` prop, disable buttons based on `isMoving || isInCombat`, and update tooltip text accordingly.
*   Added relevant unit tests for `useGame`, `CharacterInfo`, and `MovementControls`.
*   Fixed prop passing in `AppInitializer` and `GameView`.

**Design Ref Notes:**
*   **Goal:** Indicate when the player is in combat to prevent confusion when actions like movement are blocked.
*   **Logic:** State is active if the `combatants: CharacterLite[]` list from `useUiSnapshot` is not empty.
*   **Core Functionality:** While active, movement actions MUST be disabled.
*   **Related:** Part of core combat loop feedback; complements Area View (Feature H) which highlights specific combatants.

**UI & Implementation Details:**

1.  **"In Combat" Banner:**
    *   **Placement:** Display prominently but unobtrusively (e.g., top center, near character status, or above action bar).
    *   **Appearance:** Use a distinct background (muted red/orange), a clear icon (e.g., ‚öîÔ∏è, üõ°Ô∏è, ‚ùó), concise text ("IN COMBAT"), and potentially a subtle pulse/glow.
    *   **Transition:** Use fade-in/fade-out (200-300ms) for smoother appearance/disappearance.

2.  **Disabled Movement Buttons:**
    *   **Appearance:** Standard greyed-out state. Consider adding a small lock icon (üîí) overlay specifically when disabled *due to combat*.
    *   **Tooltip (MVP Critical):** On hover, MUST display an explicit tooltip: "Cannot move while in combat". (Note: The original plan marked tooltips as nice-to-have, but the conversation emphasized their importance for clarity, making them MVP Critical).

3.  **Interaction:**
    *   Banner and button states must update reactively based on the `combatants` list in the polled data.
