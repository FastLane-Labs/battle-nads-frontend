# T - Transaction History UI

*(Details TBD)*

**Design Ref Notes:**
*   Explicitly cut/postponed from MVP.
*   Reason: Duplicates chain explorers and strains Monad archive nodes.
*   Historical fetch beyond current session also postponed.
*   Related endpoint (`transaction hash â†’ character resolver`) was removed as owner-based lookup now exists.
