# Battle-Nads Frontend â€” High-Level Execution Plan

Grouping features by Must-Have (MVP) vs Next-Wave (Nice-to-Have / Polish) so you can slice them into breakout tasks later. No code detailsâ€”just the WHAT & WHY.

## 1. Guiding Principles

| Principle         | Rationale                                                                  |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gameplay First    | Ship a fully playable core loop (move â†’ combat â†’ loot â†’ level-up).           |
| Single Source of Truth | Keep polling + query cache (`useUiSnapshot`) as the canonical data feed.     |
| Gas UX            | Session-key & funding flows must never block actions.                      |
| Async Visibility  | Players should always know why they're waiting (tasks, cooldowns).          |

## 2. Must-Have Features (MVP)

| # | Feature Group                   | Impact                               | Key User Story                                                                 |
|:--|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A | Combat & Event Log Rendering    | ðŸ”¥ Criticalâ€”explains what just happened | "After I attack, I want to see hits, crits, XP gained, and loot messages."       |
| B | Area View (Other Entities)      | ðŸ”¥ Situational awareness & targeting   | "I can see nearby monsters/players with health bars & select a target."        |
| C | Ability Use & Cooldown Indicators | ðŸ”¥ Core combat mechanic                | "I can pick an ability, see if it's on cooldown, and know when it's ready."    |
| D | Session Key Management UI       | ðŸ”¥ Blocks every transaction            | "I can create, view expiry/balance, and deactivate my session key."          |
| E | Gas / shMON Funding Prompts     | ðŸ”¥ Prevents soft-locks                 | "If my balances are low, I'm warned and can top-up in-app."                   |
| F | Chat History Rendering          | ðŸ’¬ Social glue                         | "I see zone chat scroll in real time while I play."                          |
| G | Async Feedback & Loading States | ðŸ§­ Aligns expectations                 | "Whenever an action is pending (task queued), I see a spinner/progress badge." |

**Delivery Goal:** A player can create a character, explore, fight, chat, and manage gas without leaving the browser.

## 3. Next-Wave Features (High ROI but Not Blocking MVP)

| # | Feature Group                        | Benefit                            | Notes                                                                       |
|:--|:-------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| H | Equipment Inventory Management       | Deepens RPG loop                   | View backpack, equip/unequip items. Relies on poll data & `useEquipment`.     |
| I | Stat Allocation UI                   | Player progression                 | Spend level-up points; small contract write (`allocatePoints`).             |
| J | Monster & Boss Visual Differentiation | Immersion & clarity                | Icons/colors for elites, bosses, dead entities.                            |
| K | Task & Ability Timers                | Transparency                       | Real-time countdown (blockâ†’seconds). Builds on cooldown meta from MVP.        |
| L | Error Boundary & Typed Errors        | Stability                          | Central wrapper around game routes using existing custom errors.            |
| M | Event Listeners (Log Subscriptions)  | Snappier UX                        | Supplement polling for near-instant updates; graceful fallback to polling. |

## 4. Polish & Long-Term Enhancements

| # | Feature Group                      | Purpose                                       |
|:--|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| N | Death / Revival Flow               | Full loop handlingâ€”death screen, options, redirect. |
| O | Depth & Dungeon Progress UI        | Sense of long-term progress, map overview.    |
| P | Onboarding / Guided Tutorial       | New-player conversion.                        |
| Q | Mobile & Accessibility Pass        | Broader reach & compliance.                   |
| R | Sepukku UI                         | Niche but fun "rage-quit" action.              |
| S | Class Visualization During Creation | Immediate feedback on build choices.          |

## 5. Sequencing & Dependencies

1.  **Foundation**
    *   Finalize mocked data contracts for logs, combatants, ability cooldowns to unblock UI work.
    *   Confirm `pollForFrontendData` shape stability.
2.  **MVP Track (A â†’ G)**
    *   Tackle A & B in parallel (shared snapshot data).
    *   Slipstream D & E once gas data surfaces in the same snapshot.
    *   Implement C after core combat targets (B) are interactive.
    *   Integrate F & G continuously; they're mostly UI wrappers.
3.  **Hardening & Expansion**
    *   Layer H-M iteratively, leveraging the stable snapshot and existing hooks.
    *   Each adds depth without massive contract changes.
4.  **Polish Track**
    *   Schedule N-S post-launch or when design bandwidth allows.
