## Purpose
These instructions guide the agent to document relevant details for each active task and maintain up-to-date records of high-level architecture changes.

## Documentation Guidelines

1. **docs/plan.md**
   - **Task-Focused Updates**: For each new or ongoing task, summarize key actions, decisions, and progress here.
   - **Granularity**: Capture the “what” and “why” of the current task. Include concise notes on implementation approach, known blockers, and important rationale.
   - **Frequency**: Update `docs/plan.md` at logical milestones rather than after every minor edit, to avoid unnecessary detail.

2. **docs/architecture**
   - **Big-Picture Scope**: Record overarching or structural changes that affect how the application is organized or how its components interact.
   - **When to Update**: Only update `docs/architecture.md` if a change significantly impacts the global design, framework choices, or major project boundaries.
   - **High-Level Detail**: Keep this file focused on large-scale decisions and architectural rationale. Avoid duplicating low-level code examples or minor details.

3. **Avoid Duplication**
   - **Code/Framework Rules**: Any language- or framework-specific rules are handled by separate glob-based instructions. Do not repeat them in these docs.
   - **Single Source of Truth**: If an explanation exists in one doc file, reference it rather than restating it in another.

## Best Practices

- **Clarity Over Volume**: Provide just enough information for the team to understand each change’s intent, without overwhelming them with trivial updates.
- **Respect Task Boundaries**: Only include updates relevant to the current task in `docs/plan.md`. If a change has architectural impact, note it in `docs/architecture`.
- **Ask When Unsure**: If you’re uncertain whether a change belongs in `docs/plan.md` or `docs/architecture`, seek clarification.
- **Minimal Interruption**: Avoid constant notifications. Document in batches or upon completing a discrete chunk of work.
