# Comment policy
- Add comments **only** when they explain logic, edge cases, or a TODO the user asked for.
- Never add meta notes like “added this”, “removed that”, or “no need to change this”.
- Keep existing comments unless they are wrong or outdated.
- Don’t strip author headers or license banners.

# Edit scope
- Touch comment lines only if tied to the user’s request.
- Skip unrelated comment changes.

# Confidence
- Change comments only when ≥ 90 % sure they add value.
- If unsure, ask the user first.

# Diff hygiene
- Show only comment lines you changed.
- Leave untouched comments as they are.
