## Exploring the Dungeon

### The Three-Dimensional World

Battle Nads' dungeon exists in three dimensions:
- **X-axis**: East ‚Üê ‚Üí West
- **Y-axis**: North ‚Üê ‚Üí South  
- **Z-axis**: Up ‚Üê ‚Üí Down (depth levels)

Each location can hold up to 64 heroes. When you move, you're exploring an infinite procedurally generated world.

### Movement & Monster Encounters

**How Movement Works:**
1. Click any directional arrow to move
2. Your hero walks to the new location
3. If monsters lurk there, combat begins automatically
4. Win the battle to claim that spot

**Monster Spawning:**
- Moving to a new location may spawn monsters
- Deeper levels (lower Z) have tougher enemies
- Monster strength scales with dungeon depth
- Each area generates monsters based on its coordinates

**Finding Staircases:**
- Special locations contain staircases
- Use them to move between depth levels
- Deeper levels = better rewards but harder monsters
- Surface level (Z: 0) is safest for new heroes

### Navigation Tips

- Start by exploring horizontally (X/Y axes) at depth 0
- Build strength before venturing deeper
- Remember your path - respawning puts you back at origin
- Watch for other heroes' movements in the activity feed

## Combat & Abilities

### Automated Battle System

When you encounter monsters:
1. Combat starts automatically
2. Heroes and monsters take turns attacking
3. Your abilities activate based on cooldowns
4. Battle continues until one side falls

### Understanding Abilities

Each class has two unique abilities that define their combat style:

**‚öîÔ∏è Warrior Abilities**
- **Shield Bash**: Stun enemies and deal damage (12-second cooldown)
- **Shield Wall**: Boost your defenses temporarily (12-second cooldown)

**üó°Ô∏è Rogue Abilities**
- **Evasive Maneuvers**: Dodge incoming attacks (9-second cooldown)
- **Apply Poison**: Inflict damage over time (32-second cooldown)

**üôè Monk Abilities**
- **Pray**: Restore health over time (36-second cooldown)
- **Smite**: Call down divine damage (12-second cooldown)

**üîÆ Sorcerer Abilities**
- **Fireball**: Blast enemies with magic (28-second cooldown)
- **Charge Up**: Boost your next attack (18-second cooldown)

**üéµ Bard Abilities**
- **Sing Song**: Confuse yourself (no cooldown)
- **Do Dance**: Distract yourself (no cooldown)

### Cooldown System

- Abilities use block-based timing (1 block = 0.5 seconds)
- Each ability has a unique cooldown period
- Cooldowns start after ability activation
- Plan your ability usage for maximum effectiveness

### Combat Flow

1. **Engagement**: Monster appears, combat begins
2. **Auto-Attack**: Heroes attack each round automatically  
3. **Ability Usage**: Special moves activate when ready
4. **Victory**: Defeat all monsters to claim the location
5. **Defeat**: Fall in battle and respawn at origin

## Death & Rebirth

### The Cycle of Heroes

Death isn't the end in Battle Nads:

**When You Fall:**
- Your hero respawns at origin (0, 0, 0)
- You lose 10% of your shMON (minimum 100)
- Equipment remains with you
- A monument marks where you died

**Death Monuments:**
- Show where heroes have fallen
- Display the hero's name and class
- Serve as warnings for dangerous areas
- Create a living history of the dungeon

### Strategic Deaths

Sometimes death can be tactical:
- Return to origin quickly
- Redistribute wealth (10% goes to survivors)
- Escape from deep, dangerous areas
- Reset your position for new exploration

---

## Treasures & Equipment

### Finding Gear

Equipment drops from defeated monsters:
- **Weapons**: Increase your damage output
- **Armor**: Boost your defense rating
- **Accessories**: Provide various bonuses

### Equipment Rarity

Items come in different quality tiers:
- Common (Gray)
- Uncommon (Green)  
- Rare (Blue)
- Epic (Purple)
- Legendary (Orange)

Higher rarity = better stats = greater power

### Managing Your Inventory

- Equip items through your character screen
- Compare stats before swapping gear
- Some items are class-specific
- Inventory space is limited - choose wisely

---

## The shMON Economy

### Understanding shMON

shMON (short for "sharing MON") is the lifeblood of Battle Nads:
- Start with 10,000 shMON
- Earn more by defeating monsters
- Lose 10% when you die
- Required for advanced features

### Token Distribution

When a hero dies:
- 10% of their shMON distributes to all living heroes
- Distribution happens automatically
- Creates a shared economy
- Encourages both cooperation and competition

### Spending shMON

Use your tokens for:
- Creating additional heroes
- Future marketplace transactions
- Special dungeon features
- Trading with other players (coming soon)

---

## Advanced Features

### Session Keys - Play Without Gas

Battle Nads uses "session keys" for seamless gameplay:
- Approve once, play freely
- No gas fees during gameplay  
- Sessions last 7 days
- Automatic management in background

### Task Automation

The Task Manager helps automate repetitive actions:
- **Auto-Explore**: Continuously move in patterns
- **Farm Mode**: Battle monsters in one area
- **Depth Diving**: Systematically explore downward

Access through the wrench icon in-game.

### The Monument System

Death monuments create emergent gameplay:
- Track dangerous areas
- Find popular farming spots
- Learn from others' mistakes
- Build your legacy in the dungeon

### Multi-Hero Management

Advanced players can control multiple heroes:
- Create diverse class combinations
- Explore different areas simultaneously
- Maximize shMON generation
- Build a hero empire

### shMON Staking & Enhanced RPC

**Stake Your shMON for Better Performance**

Visit [shmonad.xyz](https://shmonad.xyz) to stake your shMON tokens and unlock:

- **Higher RPC throughput** - More requests per second based on your stake
- **Priority block propagation** - Receive blocks earlier for latency-sensitive operations
- **Regional optimization** - Faster read requests through distributed nodes
- **Bandwidth guarantees** - Dedicated throughput instead of "best effort" service

**How It Works:**
1. Stake shMON at [shmonad.xyz](https://shmonad.xyz)
2. Higher stake = higher bandwidth allocation
3. Supports 90%+ of Monad validators in the FastLane network
4. Future features include on-chain usage proofs and automated enforcement

**Performance Benefits:**
- Reduced latency for game actions
- More reliable connection during peak times
- Priority access to blockchain data
- Better sync for multi-hero management

For technical details about the RPC architecture, see the [full explanation thread](https://x.com/ThogardPvP/status/1945533868439998938).

### Professional Gaming Setup

For competitive players seeking optimal performance:

**RPC Configuration:**
- Use shMON-staked RPC endpoints for guaranteed bandwidth
- Consider direct peering for ultra-low latency
- Monitor your usage to avoid overage fees

**Connection Optimization:**
- Stable internet connection (wired preferred)
- Low-latency regions closer to validators
- Browser performance mode enabled
- Hardware wallet for faster transaction signing
